### RotMS

Adjusts a stereo signal's spatiality. 
Attenuation of the signal in both internal MS/AB conversions is equally distributed (-3dB) for unity gain values.

### MSConvert

Convert a stereo signal either from MS to AB or vice versa. 
Attenuation of the signal is equally distributed (-3dB) over both conversions, i.e. `sig->MSConvert->MSConvert == sig` for unity gain values.
